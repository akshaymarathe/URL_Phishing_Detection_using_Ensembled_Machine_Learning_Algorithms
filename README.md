# URL_Phishing_Detection_using_Ensembled_Machine_Learning_Algorithms
This project consists of a comparative study of different Machine Learning algorithms like SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, and ensemble algorithms like XGBoost and Stacking to know if ensemble algorithms can do a better prediction rather than standard machine learning algorithms.
